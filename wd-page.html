                Workday People Experience is a version of Workday that is optimized for the everyday employee.
                <br>
                <br>
                The everyday employee has a job to get back to. They want to get out of workday as soon as they can.
                <br>
                <br>
                Actionable search result allow users to complete an activity from the search result page instead of clicking through to a report or application.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the 2019 Workday Global Hackathon I teamed up with engineers across Workday to design and build an actionable search results card. 
                Workday Assistant had conversational features that allowed users to make time off requests from within the chat interface. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Assistant's NLP capabilities allowed users to type in a phrase like "time off", and assistant would offer to execute a time off request.
                Our team added Assistant's NLP functionality as a search pre-processor that allowed us to surface Workday Assistant suggested results, and a interface for creating a time off request without needing to click through and load a new time-off report.
                <br>
                <br>
                Below is a mock I made 2 years later from memory and with help from the <a style="color: #0875E1;" href="https://design.workday.com/" alt="canvas">Workday Canvas Design System</a>. 
                In this sense it's more a reimagning of the Workday search experience, and does not bare much resesmbelnce to any product I actually worked on. I like mine better.

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The new flow was three times faster than the existing experience</li>
        <li>Actionable results were not implemented into the GA product, but Assistant's NLP capabilities were.</li>
        </ul>
